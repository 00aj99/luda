<h2 id="font-weight">Font Weight</h2>

<p>Font weight utility classes are named using the format: <code class="highlighter-rouge">.fw-{value}</code>.
We use meaningful value words in the class names,
all the value words are listed in the below table.</p>

<div class="table table-border my-small">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr><th>Word</th><th>Value</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>lightest</td><td>100</td></tr>
      <tr><td>lighter</td><td>200</td></tr>
      <tr><td>light</td><td>300</td></tr>
      <tr><td>regular</td><td>400</td></tr>
      <tr><td>medium</td><td>500</td></tr>
      <tr><td>semibold</td><td>600</td></tr>
      <tr><td>bold</td><td>700</td></tr>
      <tr><td>bolder</td><td>800</td></tr>
      <tr><td>boldest</td><td>900</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

<p>When you use font weight utilities,
make sure the value words you pick up are supported by the fonts you embedded
in your projects. Otherwise, the font weight effects will not be visible.</p>
