  <h1>Digging Into The Display Property: Grids All The Way Down</h1>
  <p class="p7 c-muted">Written by Super User on 12 April 2012. Posted in Blog</p>

  <p class="p5">
    Continuing a series on the display property in CSS, this time Rachel Andrew takes a look at what happens when you use grid as a value of display.
  </p>


  <p>
    Today, we are going to take a look at what happens when we use display: grid and how we might use the new subgrid value of grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows to allow for grids all the way down through our markup, which relate to each other.

  <h2>What Happens When We Create A Grid Container?</h2>

  <p>CSS Grid Layout is switched on by using display: grid. If you have read the first article in this series, you will know that what this single value property actually means is display: block grid. We get a block level box which is defined as a grid container, with direct children that are grid items and participate in grid layout.</p>

  <p>If you take a look at the display specification, you will see that in the table that defines all of the different values for display. The words grid container are linked to the definition of a grid container in the Grid Specification. Therefore, to find out what this actually means we need to go look there. When we do, we get some useful clarification of the behavior of a grid container.</p>

      Avian carriers can provide high delay, low
        throughput, and low altitude service.  The
        connection topology is limited to a single
        point-to-point path for each carrier, used with
        standard carriers, but many carriers can be used
        without significant interference with each other,
        outside of early spring.  This is because of the 3D
        ether space available to the carriers, in contrast
        to the 1D ether used by IEEE802.3.  The carriers
        have an intrinsic collision avoidance system, which
        increases availability.
